# ACR (Average Candle Range) With Targets

![ACR With Targets Example](acr-example.png)

## Overview
This Pine Script indicator calculates the Average Candle Range (ACR) based on an inputted number of previous candles and a user-selected timeframe. It uses each candleâ€™s high and low to compute an average range and then draws bullish and bearish target lines for the current candle based on that average. This helps traders estimate the potential range of the selected candle period automatically.

## Why I Built It  
I built this indicator to make average range targeting more flexible and accessible for both **scalping** and **swing trading**, not just intraday use. The ability to choose **any timeframe** for the average range calculation sets it apart from most similar tools on TradingView, which are usually locked to daily ranges. My goal was to create something more **versatile and unique** for traders who want to adapt this concept to different styles and timeframes.

## Features
- Calculates ACR over a customizable number of previous candles.
- Selectable timeframe (e.g., 1H, 4H, 1D, etc.).
- Draws vertical lines to mark the beginning of each new candle in the selected timeframe.
- Extends target lines a user-defined number of bars past the current price.
- Displays a table showing the average range and the past 5 candle ranges.
- Draws bullish and bearish target lines based on the current candleâ€™s high or low plus/minus the average range.
- Customizable line styles (solid, dotted, dashed), colors, widths, and labels.
- Adjustable table position, frame, and border width.
- Options to toggle display of targets and table elements.

## Inputs
- **Timeframe** for ACR calculation (e.g., "1H", "4H", "1D").

- Show average range and previous 5 candles in the table.
